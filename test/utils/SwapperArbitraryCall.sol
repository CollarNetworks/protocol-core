/*
This is not a test-util, but rather a possible replacement swapper.

Compared to a highly constrained swapper like SwapperUniV3, this swapper is more flexible,
since can work with any router / any interface. But it has more surface area,
and delegates more complexity to the front-end (because it needs to construct the swap payload),
as well requires more trust from users - due to having to approve a hard-to-inspect payload

pros:
    - more flexibility after audits / deployment, can use any router (uni, 1inch, etc..)
    - less code
    - any stuck tokens can be drained

cons:
    - much more attack surface area
    - reentrancy needs to be either prevented or be proven to be non-issue (no inconsistent state)
    - more complicated front-end: construct payload, and show user what they are signing
    - more trust to users - can call malicious contracts
    - more trust of users to front-end - FE crafts the more complex payload
    - more testing for surface area / correctness for actual usage (fork tests for integrations)
    - any approval mistakenly granted to this swapper will be drained
