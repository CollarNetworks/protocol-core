/**
 * @title Rolls
 * @custom:security-contact security@collarprotocol.xyz
 * @dev This contract manages the "rolling" of existing collar positions before expiry to new strikes and
 * expiry.
 *
 * Main Functionality:
 * 1. Allows providers to create and cancel roll offers for existing positions.
 * 2. Allows takers to execute rolls, cancelling existing collar positions and creating new ones
 *    with updated terms.
 * 4. Manages the transfer of funds between takers and providers during rolls.
 *
 * Role in the Protocol:
 * Allows for the extension or modification of existing positions prior to expiry if both parties agree.
 *
 * Key Assumptions and Prerequisites:
 * 1. The CollarTakerNFT and CollarProviderNFT contracts are correctly implemented and authorized.
 * 2. The cash asset (ERC-20) used is simple (non-rebasing, no transfer fees, no callbacks).
 * 3. Providers must approve this contract to transfer their CollarProviderNFTs and cash when creating
 * an offer. The NFT is transferred on offer creation, and cash will be transferred on execution, if
 * and when the taker accepts the offer.
 * 4. Takers must approve this contract to transfer their CollarTakerNFTs and any cash that's needed
 * to be pulled.
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * 1. Does not hold cash (only during execution), but will have approvals to spend cash.
 * 2. Signed integers are used for many input and output values, and proper care should be
 * taken in understanding the semantics of the positive and negative values.
 *
 * Post-Deployment Configuration:
 * - CollarTakerNFT and CollarProviderNFT: Ensure properly configured
 * - ConfigHub: If this contract is used through Loans, set setCanOpenPair() to authorize this
 * contract for its asset pair
