/**
 * @title CollarTakerNFT
 * @custom:security-contact security@collarprotocol.xyz
 *
 * Main Functionality:
 * 1. Manages the taker side of collar positions - handling position creation and settlement.
 * 2. Mints NFTs representing taker positions, allowing cancellations, rolls,
 *    and a secondary market for unexpired positions.
 * 3. Settles positions at expiry by calculating final payouts using oracle prices.
 * 4. Handles cancellation and withdrawal of settled positions.
 *
 * Role in the Protocol:
 * This contract acts as the core engine for the Collar Protocol, working in tandem with
 * CollarProviderNFT to create zero-sum paired positions. It holds and calculates the taker's side of
 * collars, which is typically wrapped by LoansNFT to create loan positions.
 *
 * Key Assumptions and Prerequisites:
 * 1. Takers must be able to receive ERC-721 tokens to withdraw earnings.
 * 2. The allowed provider contracts are trusted and properly implemented.
 * 3. The ConfigHub contract correctly manages protocol parameters and authorization.
 * 4. Asset (ERC-20) contracts are simple, non rebasing, do not allow reentrancy, balance changes
 *    correspond to transfer arguments.
 * 5. nonReentrant is used on all balance changing methods to prevent a malicious ProviderNFT
 *    from fooling balance checks.
 *
 * Post-Deployment Configuration:
 * - Oracle: If using Uniswap ensure adequate observation cardinality, if using Chainlink ensure correct config.
 * - ConfigHub: Set setCanOpenPair() to authorize this contract for its asset pair
 * - ConfigHub: Set setCanOpenPair() to authorize the provider contract
 * - CollarProviderNFT: Ensure properly configured
