/**
 * @title EscrowSupplierNFT
 * @notice Manages escrows and escrow offers for LoansNFT.
 * @custom:security-contact security@collarprotocol.xyz
 *
 * Main Functionality:
 * 1. Allows suppliers to create and manage escrow offers for multiple loans contracts.
 * 2. Mints NFTs representing escrow positions when offers are taken.
 * 3. Handles starting, ending, and switching of escrow positions.
 * 4. Manages withdrawals of released escrows and seizure of overdue escrows.
 *
 * Difference vs. CollarProviderNFT:
 * - Asset: Escrow is "supplied" in underlying tokens (e.g., ETH), while "providers"
 * provide cash (e.g., USDC).
 * - Risk: "Suppliers" (as opposed to "providers") have no downside, and no exposure to price,
 * and have fixed / limited upside (interest and late fees).
 * - Optional: only used for escrow backed loans for specific tax reasons, not for regular loans.
 *
 * Key Assumptions and Prerequisites:
 * 1. Escrow suppliers must be able to receive ERC-721 to use this contract.
 * 2. The associated Loans contracts are trusted and properly implemented.
 * 3. ConfigHub contract correctly manages protocol parameters and authorization.
 * 4. Asset (ERC-20) contracts are simple (non rebasing), do not allow reentrancy. Balance
 *    changes corresponds to transfer arguments.
 *
 * Post-Deployment Configuration:
 * - ConfigHub: Set valid collar duration range
 * - ConfigHub: Set setCanOpenPair() to authorize this contract for its asset
 * - ConfigHub: Set setCanOpenPair() to authorize its loans contracts
 * - This Contract: Set loans that can open escrows
