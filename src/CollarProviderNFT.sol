/**
 * @title CollarProviderNFT
 * @custom:security-contact security@collarprotocol.xyz
 *
 * Main Functionality:
 * 1. Allows liquidity providers to create and manage offers for a specific Taker contract.
 * 2. Mints NFTs representing provider positions when offers are taken allowing cancellations, rolls,
 *    and a secondary market for unexpired positions.
 * 3. Handles settlement and cancellation of positions.
 * 4. Manages withdrawals of settled positions.
 *
 * Role in the Protocol:
 * This contract acts as the interface for liquidity providers in the Collar Protocol.
 * It works in tandem with a corresponding CollarTakerNFT contract, which is trusted by this contract
 * to manage the taker side of position, as well as calculating the positions' payouts.
 *
 * Key Assumptions and Prerequisites:
 * 1. Liquidity providers must be able to receive ERC-721 tokens and withdraw offers or earnings
 *    from this contract.
 * 2. The associated taker contract is trusted and properly implemented.
 * 3. The ConfigHub contract correctly manages protocol parameters and authorization.
 * 4. Put strike percent is assumed to always equal the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio.
 * 5. Asset (ERC-20) contracts are simple, non rebasing, do not allow reentrancy, balance changes
 *    correspond to transfer arguments.
 *
 * Post-Deployment Configuration:
 * - ConfigHub: Properly configured LTV, duration, and protocol fee parameters
 * - ConfigHub: Set setCanOpenPair() to authorize this contract for its asset pair [underlying, cash, provider]
 * - ConfigHub: Set setCanOpenPair() to authorize its paired taker contract [underlying, cash, taker]

        1. fullNotional = providerLocked * BIPS_BASE / (callStrikePercent - BIPS_BASE)
            - providerLocked was proportionally calculated from callStrikePercent
            in CollarTakerNFT.calculateProviderLocked from takerLocked
            - takerLocked was proportional to putStrikePercent in LoansNFT._swapAndMintCollar
            So to get to full notional that was used in LoanNFT we need to divide providerLocked by
            (callStrikePercent - 100%).

        2. Apply the APR:
            fee = fullNotional * feeAPR * duration / (BIPS_BASE * YEAR)

        3. Combine 1 and 2:
            fee =  providerLocked * BIPS_BASE * feeAPR * duration / ((callStrikePercent - BIPS_BASE) * BIPS_BASE * YEAR)

        4. Simplify BIPS_BASE:
            fee =  providerLocked * feeAPR * duration / ((callStrikePercent - BIPS_BASE) * YEAR
        */
