/**
 * @title LoansNFT
 * @custom:security-contact security@collarprotocol.xyz
 * @dev This contract manages opening, closing, and rolling of loans via Collar positions,
 * with optional escrow support.
 *
 * Main Functionality:
 * 1. Allows users to open loans by providing underlying and borrowing against it, with or without escrow.
 * 2. Handles the swapping of underlying to the cash asset via allowed Swappers (that use dex routers).
 * 3. Wraps CollarTakerNFT (keeps it in the contract), and mints an NFT with loanId == takerId to the user.
 * 4. Manages loan closure, repayment of cash, swapping back to underlying, and releasing escrow if needed.
 * 5. Provides keeper functionality for automated loan closure to mitigate price fluctuation risks.
 * 6. Allows rolling (extending) the loan via an owner and user approved Rolls contract.
 *
 * Key Assumptions and Prerequisites:
 * 1. Allowed Swappers and the dex routers / aggregators they use are properly implemented.
 * 2. Depends on ConfigHub, CollarTakerNFT, CollarProviderNFT, EscrowSupplierNFT, Rolls, and their
 * dependencies (Oracle).
 * 3. Assets (ERC-20) used are simple: no hooks, balance updates only and exactly
 * according to transfer arguments (no rebasing, no FoT), 0 value approvals and transfers work.
 *
 * Post-Deployment Configuration:
 * - ConfigHub: Set setCanOpenPair() to authorize this contract for its asset pair
 * - ConfigHub: Set setCanOpenPair() to authorize: taker, provider, rolls contracts for the asset pair.
 * - ConfigHub: If allowing escrow, set setCanOpenPair() to authorize escrow for underlying and ANY_ASSET.
 * - CollarTakerNFT and CollarProviderNFT: Ensure properly configured
 * - EscrowSupplierNFT: If allowing escrow, ensure properly configured
 * - This Contract: Set an allowed default swapper
 * - This Contract: Set allowed closing keeper if using keeper functionality

            for example, a shorter, or no min-grace period, or can charge regular interest during it.
