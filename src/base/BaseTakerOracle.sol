            1. answer: 0 means up, 1 down
            2. startedAt is the latest change of status because this oracle is updated via L1->L2,
            only on changes. This is different from usual feeds that are updated periodically.
            E.g., in Oct 2024, startedAt of Arbitrum mainnet feed (0xFdB631F5EE196F0ed6FAa767959853A9F217697D)
            was was 1713187535, or 15th Apr 2024 (190 days prior).
            These are the latest triggers of updateStatus in the feed's aggregator:
                https://arbiscan.io/address/0xC1303BBBaf172C55848D3Cb91606d8E27FF38428

            Using a longer `atLeast` value will result in longer wait time for "settling down",
            and can result in DoS periods if feed starts to be updated frequently.

        - On L2 side: this is not possible as the update is ignored if timestamp if lower than previous:
